						<p>Your blog's "about me" page will be read by a vast audience that includes anyone in the world who randomly finds your site, potential employers, potential significant others, and your mom. It's your opportunity to tell the world who you are and what you do, so don't squander it.There's no "right" way to author your about me page. Some read like resumes, and others read like fun stories. Designers have the skills to add a little (or a big) artistic flair to their blogs' autobiographies, but you don't need to be a designer to be creative. Most pages at a minimum include the author's name, purpose for creating a website, and links to the author's other online content. It's all about presentation.A little stumped? We've rounded up 21 creative examples for inspiration. Add your favorite about me pages in the comments below.</p>
